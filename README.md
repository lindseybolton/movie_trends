Many people believe that movies that generate high box office sales will have high critical scores. However, box office sales are technically determined by the public. So, is there a correlation between critic reviews and sales? In this project, we conducted an analysis of these variables using Metacritic's critic review scores and IMDb charts. We used Metacriticâ€™s critic review scores to see if there is a correlation between movie score and box office sales from IMDb charts.
